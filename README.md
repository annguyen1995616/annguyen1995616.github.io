# Welcome to the repository for https://annguyen1995616.github.io

Hi! I'm An Nguyen, an educator working towards a M.Ed. in Learning Technologies. You're looking at the code repository for my personal website that I use to give co-workers, hiring managers, students, and many others an overview of who I am and the work I do. I also include links to personal projects and a digital album of my photography. I aim to make all my educational work open and accessible and that includes the code and digital media resources for my personal website. 

Everyone is free to copy and use code and other media resources they find on this repository as they please.
